Computer Limericks

The BBC recently ran a computer limerick competition, through
"The Listener".  I've just received the issue with the winners.
The competition was to write a limerick starting
"A programming genius called ..."

The winner--

A programming genius called Hank
Wrote a system to 'access' his 'bank'
When his memory failed him
They nailed him then jailed him
Now his 'storage' is 'basic' and dank.
		W E Sword, Barningham Suffolk

Runners up--

A programming genius called Gertie
Had a penchant for graphics so dirty
No computer she knew
Would accept what she drew
Until she had tickled its QWERTY.
		C G Robbins, St Albans

A programming genius called HEAP
Had trouble in getting to sleep
So he made his lambs troup
through a huge FOR-NEXT loop
FOR 1 TO 10000: NEXT sheep.
		John Miles, Ely

A programming genius called Smiler
Thought he'd made up a simpler compiler
But through trouble with loops
Was constrained to cry 'Whoops,
This gets viler, gets viler, gets viler, ...
		J A Cade, Streatley

A programming genius called Sewter
Built a limerick-writing computer.
The metre was fine
and the rhymes quite divine
But for some reason the damn thing always
got the last line wrong.
		D Gutteridge, Chesterfield

A programming genius called Hugh
Said 'I really must see if it's true.'
So he wrote a routine
To ask 'What's it all mean?'
But the answer was still '42'.
		R Humphries, Sutton Coldfield
